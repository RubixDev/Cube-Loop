When you collect power ups, they'll disappear. If you get a power up while already having the effect, the time to have the power up will increase.
There are two types of power ups:

### Blue Power Ups
Blue power ups can spawn with a 4% Chance.
The next ten ingame seconds you're invincible, bigger and blue.

### Green Power Ups
Green power ups can spawn with a 5% Chance.
The next ten ingame seconds the game plays at half the speed and you get green.
